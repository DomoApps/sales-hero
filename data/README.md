# Sample Data

For convenience we've provided a sample dataset that you can load into your Domo instance using the Excel connector. If for whatever reason you want to update this data, you can download a new version of it by running the following command, which will download a new version of the sample data into the directory where you ran the curl command.

```
curl "https://api.mockaroo.com/api/eef09f00?count=1000&key=a3ae0f80" > "Sample Sales Data.xlsx"
```

Alternatively, you can modify the schema and download a new version of the dataset by following this link to [mockaroo.com](https://www.mockaroo.com/eef09f00)
